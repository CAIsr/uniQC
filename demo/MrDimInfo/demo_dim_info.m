%% 1. Construct common dimInfo objects:
%   a) 4D EPI-fMRI array, with fixed TR
%   b) 5D multi-coil time series
%   c) 5D multi-echo time series
%   d) Create 5D multi-coil time series via nSamples and ranges
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% a) creates standard 4D dim info array from arraySize
% presets: units, dimLabels, resolutions
arraySize   = [64 50 33 100];
dimInfo     = MrDimInfo('nSamples', arraySize);
disp(dimInfo);

%% b) creates standard 5D dim info array from arraySize and resolutions
% presets of dimLabels, startingPoint = [1 1 1 1 1];
arraySize   = [64 50 33 100 8];
resolutions = [3 3 3 2.5 1];
units       = {'mm', 'mm', 'mm', 's', ''};
dimInfo2    = MrDimInfo('nSamples', arraySize, 'resolutions', resolutions, ...
    'units', units);
disp(dimInfo2);
% no empty units allowed, will be overwritten by default!

%% c) creates standard 5D dim info array from arraySize, resolutions,
% startingPoints
% no presets
arraySize   = [64 50 33 8 3];
resolutions = [3 3 3 1 25];
units       = {'mm', 'mm', 'mm', 'nil', 'ms'};
dimLabels   = {'x', 'y', 'z', 'coil', 'echo_time'};
firstSamplingPoint = [-110, -110, -80, 0, 15];
dimInfo3    = MrDimInfo('nSamples', arraySize, 'resolutions', resolutions, ...
    'units', units, 'dimLabels', dimLabels, ...
    'firstSamplingPoint', firstSamplingPoint);
disp(dimInfo3.ranges);

%% d) Create 5D multi-coil time series via nSamples and ranges
% no presets, resolutions computed automatically
dimInfo4 = MrDimInfo(...
    'nSamples', [128 96 35 8 1000], ...
    'dimLabels', {'x', 'y', 'z', 'coil', 't'}, ...
    'units', {'mm', 'mm', 'mm', '', 's'}, ...
    'ranges', {[2 256], [2 192], [3 105], [1 8], [0 2497.5]});
disp(dimInfo4);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Get parameters of dimInfo via get_dims and dimInfo.'dimLabel'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% check out how neatly you can retrieve information about certain
% dimensions:
% dimInfo2.get_dims('x').resolutions
dimInfo2.x.resolutions
dimInfo2.get_dims('x')
dimInfo2.get_dims({'x' 'y' 'z'})

%% even cooler: use dimLabels directly for referencing!
dimInfo2.z.samplingPoints
dimInfo2.nSamples('z')
dimInfo2.nSamples({'z','y'})

dimInfo2('z')
dimInfo2({'z', 'y'})
dimInfo2([3 2])

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 2. Modify dimInfo-dimensions via set_dims/add_dims-command
% a) Specify non-consecutive sampling-points (e.g. coil channels)
% b) Shift start sample of dimensions (e.g. centre FOV in x/y)
% c) Add a 6th dimension (e.g. additinal echoes)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% a) Specify non-consecutive sampling-points (e.g. coil channels)
disp(dimInfo3);
dimInfo3.set_dims('coil', 'samplingPoints', [2 3 4 7 8 10 11 12])
% Note that there is no concept of resolution here anymore, since there is
% equidistant spacing!
dimInfo3.resolutions
% However, samplingWidths is retained, since the data is still coming from
% one coil (a better way to think of it would be to select a number of
% slices; the resolution would be nan but each slice would still have a
% thickness = samplingWidth [which is the true slice thickness, resolution
% would be composed of samplingWidth + sliceGap])
dimInfo3.samplingWidths


% b) Shift start sample of dimensions (e.g. centre FOV in x/y)
disp(dimInfo4);
dimInfo4.set_dims([1 2], 'arrayIndex', [65 49], 'samplingPoint', [0 0]);
dimInfo4.ranges(:,1:2)

disp(dimInfo3);
dimInfo3.samplingPoints('coil') = {13:15};
dimInfo3.z.samplingPoints = {1:20};
dimInfo3.echo_time.nSamples = 5;

% c) Add a 6th dimension (e.g. additinal echoes)
disp(dimInfo2);
dimInfo2.add_dims(6, 'samplingPoints', [17 32], 'dimLabels', 'echo', 'units', 'ms');

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 3. Display sampling points (=absolute indices with units) of
% selected first/center/last voxel
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

arrayIndexFirst     = [1,1,1,1,1];

end

%% 4. dimInfo.select() - extract subset of dimension info from
%                        PropName/Value-pairs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% a) Select only data from a specific subset of one dimension (e.g. all
% data from some coils)
[selectionDimInfo, selectionIndexArray] = dimInfo4.select('type', 'index', ...
    'coil', [2 3 5 6]);

%% b) Select all data excluding subsets of one dimension (e.g. first volumes
% of time series data)
[selectionDimInfo2, selectionIndexArray2] = dimInfo4.select('type', 'index', ...
    'invert', true, 't', [1:5]);

%% c) Select subset of data array from multiple dimensions (e.g. cubic volume ROI,
% but see MrRoi for more sophisticated region definitions)
[selectionDimInfo3, selectionIndexArray3] = dimInfo4.select('type', 'index', ...
    'x', [20:40 80:100],  'y', [1:16 81:96], 'z', [10:15]);

%% d) Select subset of data array by specifying sampling-points
[selectionDimInfo4, selectionIndexArray4] = dimInfo4.select('type', 'sample', ...
    'x', [-128:2:0],  'y', [0:2:80]);

%% e) Combine selection into a nice structure, instead of
% ParameterName/Value-pairs (not all have to be given!)
selection.x = 1:10;
selection.t = 200:300;
[selectionDimInfo5, selectionIndexArray5] = dimInfo4.select(selection);
