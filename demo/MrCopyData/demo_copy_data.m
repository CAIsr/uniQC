% Script demo_copy_data
% Shows functionality of MrCopyData for deep cloning and recursive operations
%
%  demo_copy_data
% 
% Since MrCopyData has no properties, we created a dummy class
% MrCopyDataTest with the following properties:
%   - numeric/string values, cells of nums/strings,
%   - MrCopyDataTest values and 
%   - cells of MrCopyDataTest
% to allow for a minimum comparison case of the recursive operations
% provided by MrCopyData. The MrCopyDataTest entries are recursive objects,
% but with one recursion depth less, i.e. at some point in the hierarchy,
% copydata_value and _cell will become empty
%
