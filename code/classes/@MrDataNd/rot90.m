% (Multiple of) 90 deg image rotation; mimicks rot90 in matlab functionality

%   Y = MrDataNd()
%   Y.rot90(K)
%
% This is a method of class MrDataNd.
%
% IN
%   K   multiple of 90 degrees used for counterclockwise rotation 
%       i.e.    K = 0,1,2 (counterclockwise rotation) 
%           or  K = -1,-2,-3,... (clockwise rotation);
%       default : 1
% 
% OUT
%   otherImage      MrDataNd where data matrix is rotated and header is updated to
%                   reflect that change
%
% EXAMPLE
%   Y = MrDataNd();
%   Y.rot90(1); % rotate all slices counterclockwise by 90 degrees
%   Y.rot90(-2) % rotate all slices clockwise by 2*90 = 180 degrees
