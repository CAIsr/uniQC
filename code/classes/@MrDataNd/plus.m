function outputImage = plus(this, otherImage)
% Adds data of other image to this one and writes output in new image
%
% NOTE: If voxel dimensions of 2nd image do not match - or a scalar is
% given as 2nd argument - data in the 2nd argument is automatically
% replicated to match this image geometry.
%
%
%   Y = MrImage()
%   outputImage = plus(Y, otherImage, ...
%   functionHandle)
%
% This is a method of class MrImage.
%
%
% IN
%   otherImage              image that will be added to this one
%
% OUT
%   outputImage             new MrImage, sum of this and otherImage
%
% EXAMPLE
%
%   % Compute sum of 2 images
%		Y = MrImage();
%		Z = MrImage();
%		X = Y.plus(Z);
%
%   % OR (cool overload!):
%       X = Y+Z
