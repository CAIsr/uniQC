function coeffVar = compute_coeff_var(this, varargin)
% computes standard deviation image (coeff_var) over 4th dimension of MrImage
% NOTE: short-cut for compute_stat_image('coeff_var')
%
%   Y = MrImage()
%   coeffVar = Y.compute_coeff_var('PropertyName', PropertyValue)
%
% This is a method of class MrImage.
%
% IN
%   'PropertyName'
%               'selectedVolumes'       [1,nVols] vector of selected
%                                       volumes for statistical calculation
% OUT
%   coeffVar         MrImage holding voxel-wise coefficient of variation
%                     image (coeff_var), i.e. 1./snr 
%                     (with thresholding to avoid Inf-values)

%   Y = MrImage()
