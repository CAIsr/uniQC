function PCs = pca(this, cutoff, pcDimension)
% Computes principal component analysis (PCA) of image time series
%
%   Y = MrImage()
%   PCs = pca(this, cutoff, pcDimension)
%
% This is a method of class MrImage.
%
% Spatial PCA (default):
% The principal component analysis report representative spatial
% distributions ("principal components") of fluctuation patterns that explain most variance in the
% data (over all time points).
% The corresponding temporal evolution of weights (or scores or
% projections) describes how each of these spatial patterns fluctuates over
% time.
%
% Temporal PCA (?)
% The principal component analysis reports the representative time series
% ("principal components") that explain most of the variance in the data
% (pooled over all voxels).
% The corresponding spatial maps of weights (or scores or projections) give
% the relative contribution of this particular time series to the variance
% in each voxel
%
% IN
%   cutoff      value determining number of principal components extracted
%               0 < cutoff < 1      interpreted as relative amount of
%                                   variance explained;
%                                   nPCs will be determined as the number
%                                   of components that explain at least
%                                   cutoff*100 % of the variance in the
%                                   data
%               cutoff = 1,2,3...   interpreted as number of PCs extracted
%   pcDimension 'spatial' (default) or 'temporal'
%               determines which dimension i.e. spatial image or time
%               (volumes) will be principal component, and consequently,
%               which other one will be the projection dimension
%               Technically, the non-PC dimension is the one considered to
%               "generate the variance", in that the covariance matrix
%               entries would relate PC vector components, co-varying over
%               the non-PC dimension,
%               e.g.    spatial PCA: How do two voxels co-vary over time
%                       temporal PCA: How do two time-points co-vary over
%                       space
%               Typically, the 1st projection of the temporal PCA looks
%               like the mean, and for the other components, it usually
%               holds:
%               PC_spatial(n) approximately equal to Proj_temporal(n+1)
% OUT
%   PCs         cell(nPCs,1) of MrImages
%               Each element is a 4D image, the nth volume is computed as
%                   PCs{k}_n = PC{k}*Projection_n,
%               i.e. for
%                   spatial PCA: principal component * nth time point pf
%                   projection
%                   temporal PCA: nth element of principal component *
%                   projection vector of all voxels
